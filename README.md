# Firebase Realtime Database Type Mismatch Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's Realtime Database: type mismatches between the expected data type and the actual type received from the database.  This inconsistency can lead to runtime errors and unexpected application behavior.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` offers a solution using stricter type checking and data sanitization. 

This is a critical issue to address to ensure application stability and reliability when dealing with dynamic data from the Firebase Realtime Database.
